Hi all, 

It's actually happening. My pacific crest trail section hike starts soon. The plan is for 1000 miles in about 10 weeks. 

I just did a shake-down of my equipment with a family trip to Pinnacles National Park. Today, the friendly people at [The Mountain Air](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+mountain+air) helped me cut my pack's base weight down by 30%. A few guys that did a pct thru hike last year basically took out all my backups, extras and too heavy options leaving me with the basic essentials, saying "*if you actually what I took out, have it sent after a week or two on the trail*". 

Now, with a few days of administrative sorting out for my upcoming Abu Dhabi move, Tuesday I take the Surfrider Amtrak from SLO to San Diego, to hit the trail at Campo at first light Wednesday, May 18. After that, just under 1000 miles to Yosemite Valley by July 31st .

I have a SPOT tracker arranged at [this URL, http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0Yqto1SBp1MrHmtmldF3mTYWBRej4cKNC](http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0Yqto1SBp1MrHmtmldF3mTYWBRej4cKNC). Here's the [RSS XML API if you're interested](https://api.findmespot.com/spot-main-web/consumer/rest-api/2.0/public/feed/0Yqto1SBp1MrHmtmldF3mTYWBRej4cKNC/message.xml). 

Most of my [photos will go here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/weownit). And here's [flickr's photo map](https://www.flickr.com/photos/weownit/map) (which doesn't always work well... you'll often have to scroll through the small set of photos with the left and right arrows to see everything... thanks yahoo) 

Here's [my itinerary (pct planner)](http://www.pctplanner.com/v.php?g=p4Fhp28daCq2) (I built in 9 planned zero days and several days extras just in case). This is obviously just a rough guide and will likely be way out of sync with my actual schedule. Here's the [trail I plan to take (click *raw* for a KML file for Google Earth)](https://github.com/EconomiCurtis/trailspeed/blob/master/pct_data/Curtis-2016-PCT-Section-Hike.kml) And [here's a CSV version with elevation and dist, etc](https://github.com/EconomiCurtis/trailspeed/blob/master/pct_data/pct_trail_dat.csv). 

I hope to send you a post card!
