Hi All,

It's all actually happening. 

In a few days I'll be on a 1000 mile hike starting in Campo CA and ending in Yosemite Valley July 31st.  

I just did a shakedown of my equipment with the family at Pinnacles National Park. Today, the friendly folks at The Mountain Air in SLO helped me reduce my base pack weight by 30%. A couple of guys that did a pct thru hike last year basically pulled out all my backups, extras and too heavy options, saying "*if you actually need it, decide in a few weeks and have it shipped to you.*"


You can [track my progress here (a SPOT tracker)](http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0Yqto1SBp1MrHmtmldF3mTYWBRej4cKNC). And [here's a RSS XML API](https://api.findmespot.com/spot-main-web/consumer/rest-api/2.0/public/feed/0Yqto1SBp1MrHmtmldF3mTYWBRej4cKNC/message.xml) if you prefer that. I'll post making and breaking of camp there. If you'd like, you can also signup to be a contact for when I hit the ["soft emergency" button (see Help/SPOT Assist)](http://www.findmespot.com/en/index.php?cid=100). 

I will be [posting photos on flickr here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/weownit). Here's also a [sometimes cool flickr map](https://www.flickr.com/photos/weownit/map) where you can see where each photo was taken (which isn't always the greatest ... you may have to scroll through photos with those left/right arrow keys ... thanks yahoo).

Here is [my planned itinerary](http://www.pctplanner.com/v.php?g=p4Fhp28daCq2), obviously this will be very out of sync the further I am into the trip. Note that I built in 9 planned zero days and a week of floating days. I hope that is enough!  I created a [track of my planned hike here (a kml file for your google earth - click on raw)](https://github.com/EconomiCurtis/trailspeed/blob/master/pct_data/Curtis-2016-PCT-Section-Hike.kml), and a [CSV version (with distances between points, elevation gain, etc. - agian click on raw)](https://github.com/EconomiCurtis/trailspeed/blob/master/pct_data/pct_trail_dat.csv).

After a day of dealing with administrative prep for my upcoming move to Abu Dhabi, on Tuesday I board the Surfrider train that conveniently departs from SLO and travels straight to San Diego. I hit the trail at first light Wednesday, May 18th. 

Now, please stop telling me to "break a leg", where a simple "good luck" will suffice.

I hope to send you a post card soon!

Curtis
